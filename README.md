# Memory-Game
Thank you for checking out my game! It's a bit basic but I'm pretty proud of how it turned out.
If you would like to try it out, first download each file.
Assuming you have downloaded each file, locate the html file (MemoryGame.html) on your device, right click the file and 
select "Open with" followed by "Google Chrome" or any other browser of your choosing (I would recommend Google Chrome).

The rules are simple. When you hit "start", the browser will generate 6 matching pairs of cards (12 cards in total), each pair 
has a random color generated each time a new game starts. The goal is to match up each card with another card of the same color.
If you select 2 cards of the same color, the color of the cards will be displayed for the remainder of the game. If not, the color
of the recently flipped cards will disappear after 1 second. Once the game is over, you can hit "reset" to generate a new set of cards.

The game will track the amount of time and clicks it takes for you to beat a single round, along with tracking a highscore that's
stored within localStorage. Try to beat your highscore and good luck!
